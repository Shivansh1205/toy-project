# 🎓 ML Placement Predictor

A beginner-friendly toy machine learning project that predicts whether a student will be placed based on their **CGPA** and **IQ**. This project is designed for educational purposes to understand the basic ML workflow.

## 📌 Features

- Binary classification using Logistic Regression
- Takes two input features: **CGPA** and **IQ**
- Visualizes decision boundary
- Saves trained model using `pickle`

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train-test splitting
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Model training and accuracy evaluation
- Visualizing decision boundaries
- Saving and loading ML models

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/placement-predictor.git
cd placement-predictor
```

2. **Install the dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the notebook**

Open `toy_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all the cells.

## 📊 Dataset Format

| cgpa | iq  | placement |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 8.5  | 120 | 1         |
| 6.7  | 100 | 0         |

- `placement` = `1` → Placed  
- `placement` = `0` → Not Placed

## 🖼️ Visualization

- Scatter plot showing CGPA vs IQ, colored by placement status
- Decision boundary plot using `mlxtend.plot_decision_regions`

## ✅ Example Prediction

```python
Input: CGPA = 8.5, IQ = 130  
Output: Placed ✅
```

## 📦 Requirements

```
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
```

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Disclaimer

This is a toy ML project and should not be used for actual placement predictions. It is purely for learning and demonstration purposes.
